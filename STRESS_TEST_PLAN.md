# Stress Test Plan

This document outlines the plan for stress testing the multiplayer Snake game server. The goal is to identify and diagnose concurrency issues, performance bottlenecks, and resource leaks under heavy load.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Mass Connection Test

*   **Objective:** To evaluate the server's ability to handle a large number of simultaneous client connections.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   Spawn 100 virtual client threads.
    *   Have all threads attempt to connect to the server within a very short time window (e.g., 100ms).
    *   Monitor the server for errors, exceptions, or deadlocks during the connection phase.
*   **Success Criteria:**
    *   The server successfully accepts all 100 connections without crashing or becoming unresponsive.
    *   No `ConcurrentModificationException` or other concurrency-related exceptions are thrown.
    *   The time to accept all connections is within an acceptable threshold.

### 2. High Churn Test

*   **Objective:** To test the server's stability and resource management when clients connect and disconnect rapidly.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   Spawn 50 virtual client threads.
    *   Each thread will repeatedly connect to the server, stay connected for a short random interval (e.g., 1-5 seconds), and then disconnect.
    *   This test will run for an extended period (e.g., 5 minutes).
*   **Success Criteria:**
    *   The server remains stable and responsive throughout the test.
    *   There are no resource leaks (e.g., the number of threads and open file descriptors on the server does not grow over time).
    *   The server accurately tracks the number of connected players.

### 3. High Activity Test

*   **Objective:** To simulate a high-intensity gameplay scenario where all clients are actively sending commands.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   Connect 50 clients to the server.
    *   Start the game.
    *   Each client thread will send a random direction command to the server on every game tick.
    *   Monitor server CPU usage, network I/O, and game responsiveness.
*   **Success Criteria:**
    *   The server maintains a consistent tick rate without significant degradation.
    *   The game state remains consistent and free of corruption.
    *   No race conditions are observed (e.g., two snakes occupying the same space).

### 4. Maximum Game State Test

*   **Objective:** To test the server's performance when the game state is very large.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   Connect 10 clients to the server.
    *   Start the game.
    *   Force the snakes to grow to a very long length (e.g., 50 segments each). This can be done by modifying the game logic for testing purposes to not have collisions and have snakes grow automatically.
    *   Let the game run for a period of time with these long snakes.
*   **Success Criteria:**
    *   The server can handle the large game state without a significant drop in performance.
    *   Network bandwidth usage is monitored to see the impact of the large `GameStateSnapshot`.
    *   The game remains playable and responsive.

## Tooling

*   A custom test harness will be developed using JUnit 5.
*   This harness will be capable of spawning and managing multiple virtual client threads.
*   The harness will collect and report on the success or failure of each test scenario.
*   System monitoring tools (like `jstat` or a profiler) may be used to monitor the server's resource usage during the tests.
