# Stress Test Plan

This document outlines the strategy for stress testing the multiplayer Snake game server. The goal is to identify and diagnose concurrency issues, performance bottlenecks, and resource leaks under heavy load.

## Tooling

A custom test harness built with JUnit 5 is used to execute the test scenarios. This harness is capable of spawning and managing multiple virtual client threads to simulate load. System monitoring tools (like `jstat` or a profiler) are used to monitor the server's resource usage during these tests.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Mass Connection Test

*   **Objective:** To evaluate the server's ability to handle a large number of simultaneous client connections.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   Spawn 100 virtual client threads.
    *   All threads attempt to connect to the server within a very short time window (e.g., 100ms).
    *   The server is monitored for errors, exceptions, or deadlocks during the connection phase.
*   **Success Criteria:**
    *   The server successfully accepts all 100 connections without crashing or becoming unresponsive.
    *   No `ConcurrentModificationException` or other concurrency-related exceptions are thrown.
    *   The time to accept all connections is within an acceptable threshold.

### 2. High Churn Test

*   **Objective:** To test the server's stability and resource management when clients connect and disconnect rapidly.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   Spawn 50 virtual client threads.
    *   Each thread repeatedly connects to the server, stays connected for a short random interval (e.g., 1-5 seconds), and then disconnects.
    *   This test runs for an extended period (e.g., 5 minutes).
*   **Success Criteria:**
    *   The server remains stable and responsive throughout the test.
    *   No resource leaks are observed (e.g., thread count and open file descriptors remain stable).
    *   The server accurately tracks the number of connected players.

### 3. High Activity Test

*   **Objective:** To simulate a high-intensity gameplay scenario where all clients are actively sending commands.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   Connect 50 clients to the server and start the game.
    *   Each client thread sends a random direction command to the server on every game tick.
    *   Server CPU usage, network I/O, and game tick rate are monitored.
*   **Success Criteria:**
    *   The server maintains a consistent tick rate without significant degradation.
    *   The game state remains consistent and free of corruption.
    *   No race conditions are observed.

### 4. Maximum Game State Test

*   **Objective:** To test the server's performance when handling a very large game state.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   Connect 10 clients to the server and start the game.
    *   The game logic is temporarily modified for testing purposes to force snakes to grow to a very long length (e.g., 50 segments each) without collisions.
    *   The game runs for a period of time with these long snakes.
*   **Success Criteria:**
    *   The server handles the large game state without a significant drop in performance.
    *   Network bandwidth usage is monitored to understand the impact of the large `GameStateSnapshot`.
    *   The game remains playable and responsive.
